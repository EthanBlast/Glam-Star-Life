You can now try Mingle out in our Mingle Community! Come be my friend at:

[Mingle WordPress Community](http://wpmingle.com "Mingle WordPress Community")

= Note = 
Mingle still hasn't been tested with every theme or browser in existence yet. However, Mingle was developed and works exceptionally well on the [Thesis WordPress Theme](http://blairwilliams.com/thesis "Thesis WordPress Theme") (aff link) -- which is the best theme out there anyway in my humble opinion.

Want to setup a Premium Membership Website with a built in Social Network? Now you can roll one out easily by using Mingle together with [Wishlist Member](http://blairwilliams.com/wishlistmember "Wishlist Member") (aff link). I've setup many premium memebership sites using several different software packages and like wishlist the best for its easy setup and its innovative features.
