	<P>Tips and instructions for using and configuring the Quick Post Widget.</P>

	<H3>Using the widget</H3>
	<P>
	Using the Quick Post Widget is easy. Just type in the post title, type or paste the contents of the post content en choose one, or more if you use the checklist, categories.<BR/><BR/>
	When your role allows you to create a new category, radio buttons are displayed to choose between an existing category and a new category as well as an input box for its name.<BR/><BR/>
	You can also choose a parent for the new category.<BR/><BR/>
	When you create a new category with the same name as an existing one no error message is displayed, but your post is just added to your new (existing) category.<BR/><BR/>
	You can manually type in tags or just select them from the list of existing tags. Of course you can also define new, or existing, tags just by typing them in the tags field.<BR/><BR/>
	The widget offers visual editing directly from the frontpanel of your site, without going into the backend, with a bunch of features (spellchecking, preview,....)!

	<H4>General Options</H4>
	<P>
	<UL>
		<LI>Widget title: is displayed in your front end. You could use for instance 'New post' or 'New clip'.</LI><BR/>
		<LI>Category list type: determines the way the categories are displayed. You can choose between 'Droplist' and 'Checklist'.<BR/>
		A droplist takes less space on your screen, but you can only choose one category.<BR/>
		The checklist uses more space, but has the advantage that you can choose more than one category at a time.</LI><BR/>
		<LI>Border error color: when a required item stays empty its border color changes to red (default). You can choose other colors by using the droplist.<BR/>
		Required items are post title, post content and category.<BR/>
		When the categories are displayed in the droplist you cannot forget to select a category.<BR/>
		When the categories are displayed in the checklist you should select at least one.<BR/>
		When you choose to create a new category you should type in its name.</LI><BR/>
		<LI>Publish status: you can choose to immediately publish your posts by selectin 'Publish' or set the default publish status to 'Pending' or 'Draft'.</LI><BR/>
		<LI>Disable new cat.: when for some reason you don't want to allow the creation of new categories, you can explicitly disable this feature.</LI><BR/>
		<LI>Show tags field: if you don't want to use tags you can disable this feature.</LI><BR/>
		<LI>Disable visual editor: if you do not want visual editing you can disable this feature. The widget also follows the WordPress configuration option to disable visual editing per user.</LI><BR/>
		<LI>Disable editor plugins: if you encounter difficulties you can disable the editor plugins.</LI><BR/>
		<LI>Disable media upload: if you don't want users to upload media you can disable this feature.</LI><BR/>
		<LI>Shared upload directories: by default every user has its own upload directory (automatically created in the WordPress upload directory). If you want to use a shared directory for all users you can select this.</LI><BR/>
		<LI>Newlines tag: the default tag for new lines to use in the popup editor is &lt;P&gt;. If you want you can use the &lt;BR&gt; tag, for instance to minimize the space between lines.</LI><BR/>
		<LI>Allow guests (not logged-in): this option enables the widget to anyone who is not logged-in. Of course you should only enable this option in controlled environments, especially when you allow media uploading!</LI><BR/>
		<LI>Guest account: because it is better to have a 'poster' for guest posts you have to select a dedicated account for non-logged-in guests. In the user tab you can select a role and enable or disable visual editing for this special guest account. Please read the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/quick-post-widget/faq/">FAQ</a> to configure.</LI>

	<H4>Labels</H4>
	<P>
	Here you can determine the labels for the fields in the widget. If you leave these options empty, defaults are used.<BR/>
	Of course you can use labels in your own language, but you can also use labels for your own special purpose.<BR/>
	For instance, instead of using 'Post title' you could use 'Clip title', 'Message title' etc.
	</P>
	<HR>
	<H4>Defaults</H4>
	<P>
	Here you can determine the default text to display in the post title, the post content and the parent category ans tags list droplists when nothing is entered yet.
	</P>
	<HR>
	<H4>Styles</H4>
	<P>
	Every element in the widget is styled by the stylesheet.<BR/>
	If you would like to change for instance an items border color or width you can of course change the stylesheet.<BR/>
	Instead of changing the stylesheet you can also style the elements by defining a style in the options panel.<BR/>
	It has the advantage that when you perform an upgrade of the plugin you won't lose your customizations.<BR/>
	You should use valid css style syntax. For instance if you want to change the post content height you could define 'height: 400px';
