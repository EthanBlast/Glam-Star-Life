== Change log ==

=
=*Version 1.1
-updated for Wordpress v.3.0.5
- added individual width settings for diferent areas : post, homepage, pages, category
- image classes are not changed anymore


== Description ==
Image resize wizz automatically resizes the images in posts, pages or categories to fit a maximum specified width. The pictures are not physically modified, the plugin only modifies the way the theme displays them in a post.

How does it work? 
After you set a maximum width from the admin panel, all the pictures that have a larger width than the one you have specified will be displayed in the post scaled down to the width you have set.
The graphic file is not physically altered or modified, the plugin only resizes the output shown in the browser.
